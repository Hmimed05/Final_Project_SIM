<h2>- to reproduce this project in your machine, you must continue the following steps:</h2>
  
   * run the bash file to install the working environment
   
   
   * You must create the application database on mysql with the command: <B> mysql -u root -p <srms.sql </B>(the srms.sql file is in the database file directory)
   
   
   * follow the path : <B>Final_Project & database \ Student_result_app \ includes</B> and add the Mysql password to the <B>config.php file</B>
  
   * to test the application:
      for admin:  login hamza && password: 123456789
      for student:  Rolid 123 && class: First-A
   
   <h2> Note :   </h2> 
   
   I cannot import the css and javascript files because they are more than 100 files. 
   So I compress all the files of the application in a zip under the same name of the application.
